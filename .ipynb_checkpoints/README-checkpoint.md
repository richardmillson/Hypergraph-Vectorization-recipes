Hypergraph vectorization and visual exploration
==============================
_Author: Tutte Institute for Mathematics and Computing_

A repo for using the TIMC vectorizers and thisnotthat libraries to construct a joint vertex/hyperedge embedding and exploration.

In this demo we will make use of the recipe hypergraph dataset. It consists of a set of 39559 recipes (hyperedges) made from 6714 ingredients (vertices). Each recipe in assigned to a country - out of 20 countries. The end-goal is to provide a way to explore the data, cluster and classify.
